## SUMMARY:
Please make sure you have completed the soot survey at:
    [soot.binghamton.edu](https://soot.binghamton.edu)

Please list the urls for the APIs you used:
https://api.openaq.org/v1/cities?limit=10000
https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice/CNY.json
Summary of Program:
This program uses two of the public APIs given to us. The APIs used were very complicated at first and had to scroll through many different pages to find the correct website. The first is about air quality in a specific set of cities. The List.py file creates a .txt file in which all the available cities are therefore when you type in a city and it cannot find it its because the API used does not have that cities air quality calculated. The second API is a bitcoin API which tells us the real time value of Bitcoin to USD. You simply type 1 and it will give you the live price conversion.

Most Challenging topic in the course:
The most challenging topic in this course would definetly be this most recent topic in which we had to utilize APIs. I do not understand most of the immense code given in an API. I also feel like this topic was the least emphasized on therefore I do not know how to pull everything together and create more advanced code.
## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS:
I was not able to follow the requirements given to us. I was able to understand how APIs work and how to interact with them however I was not able to understand how to incorporate "self" and "get(self)" into the code since most of the refrences I used simply coded in the format I did. I was able to incorporate classes and have the code run and produce a value but not in the format I was supposed to.
